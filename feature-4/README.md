Peter's feature: Answer checking, unit tests for answer checking, updating stats from answer checking, only displaying clues that the user has not seen yet. In order to run the unit tests for answer submission, do npm i then npm test. The test/evaluate.js file includes the function which we have on Back4App as Parse Cloud Code.
